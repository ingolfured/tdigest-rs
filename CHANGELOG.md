# Changelog

## Unreleased

* Add grouped Polars digests and CDF queries with shared Rust, Python and Java implementations.
* Preserve the original Python calling convention and support portable TDIG state in capacity mode.
* Rebuild changed delta merges in Rust and return the updated Python digest directly from native mutation methods.
* Introduce the library with a concise feature list covering Float16 input, parallel CDF queries, and TDIG serialization across languages. Include runnable Python, Polars, Rust, CLI, and Java examples and document the legacy Python API separately.
